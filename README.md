solana: Multi-threaded Ed25519 Key Generation & Target Matching Tool
solana is a high-performance, multi-threaded C++ tool that generates Ed25519 key pairs using the libsodium library. It offers both sequential and random scanning modes over a configurable keyspace and supports target address matching. Use solana to scan for keys that meet your criteriaâ€”whether you want to explore a specific range or search for target addresses (e.g., Solana addresses) from a file.

#Features
Multi-threaded Key Generation: Utilize multiple threads to maximize throughput.
Scan Modes: Choose between sequential scanning (default) or random scanning.
Custom Keyspace: Define your own keyspace range with hexadecimal start and end values.
Configurable Bit Length: Specify the key bit length (from 128 to 256 bits; default is 256).
Output Options: Save all generated keys to a file if desired.
Target Matching: Load a list of target addresses and record any matches to a file (foundsolana.txt).
Progress Reporting: Real-time output of keys generated per second and total keys scanned.
Optimized Target Loading: Uses Windows memory mapping for fast loading of target addresses (Linux support can be added).
Requirements
Compiler: A C++11 (or later) compliant compiler.
Dependencies: libsodium for cryptographic functions.
Platform: Designed for Windows (with memory mapping support); Linux users may need to implement an alternative target loader.
Build Instructions
Install libsodium:
Follow the instructions on the libsodium website to install the library on your system.

# Compile the Code:
For example, using g++ on Windows (adjust the command if needed):

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 solana.cpp -lsodium -o solana
On Linux, ensure you link against libsodium and adjust any platform-specific code.

## Usage
Run the executable from the command line with the following options:

bash
Copy
Edit
solana.exe [options]
Command-line Options
-t <threads>
Specify the number of threads to use (default: 4).

-s
Use sequential scan mode (this is the default mode).

-r
Use random scan mode.

-keyspace <start:end>
Define a custom keyspace for scanning. Both start and end should be hexadecimal strings representing the variable portion of the key.

-b <bits>
Set the key bit length (allowed values: 128 to 256; default is 256).

-o <file>
Save all generated keys to the specified output file.

-f <target_file>
Load target addresses from the specified file. Any matching public keys will be saved to foundsolana.txt.

-h, -help
Display the help message.

How It Works
Key Generation:
The program generates a block of keys either sequentially or randomly. Each key is created by:

Generating a seed from the defined keyspace.
Using crypto_sign_seed_keypair from libsodium to produce the Ed25519 key pair.
Converting the public key to a Base58 string.
Target Matching (Optional):
If a target file is provided, the tool loads target addresses (using Windows memory mapping for efficiency) and compares each generated public key against these targets. Matches are logged to foundsolana.txt.

# Output:

Console: Displays real-time statistics (keys per second, total keys generated).
File Output: If specified, all generated keys are written to a file; matching keys are saved separately.
